Convert music file formats and copy metadata

2021.01.02 - Status
Original purpose was for my own personal music issues after trying to decouple from Apple a little bit.
Some m4a format songs wouldn't play properly on my android phone even though they would copy.
Currently the script works for my purposes, and I've checked that my songs now properly play on my phone
and my player can find album art using the metadata I copy over from the m4a file.

Eventually would like to figure out if there's any hope to fixing the m4p DRM stuff (on my own) without having to pay for
something I already bought once or for additional software to remove the protection for me.
